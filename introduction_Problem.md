Introduction/ Buissness Problem 

The problem that I am looking to explore , is the spread of buissnesses in Los Angeles. This would meant to be presented to individuals/stakeholders looking into what type of buissness they would like to inquire. This is important to understand the spread of particular establishments to help determine saturation . 



Data Section

The data that I will be using first will come from the county data to help separte neighborhoods by their zipcode and geo-coordinates. Will be retreved and scraped from https://data.lacounty.gov/GIS-Data/ZIP-Codes-and-Postal-Cities/c3xr-3jw2/data . After the location data is pulled the next dataset that i will combine the location with is the Foursquare location data of Los Angeles. Foursquare data will contain venue location , its name and category.
