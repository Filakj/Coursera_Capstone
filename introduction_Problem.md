Introduction/ Buissness Problem 

The problem that I am looking to explore , is the spread of buissnesses in Los Angeles. The data that I will be using first will come from the county data to help separte neighborhoods by their zipcode and geo-coordinates. Will be retreved and scraped from https://data.lacounty.gov/GIS-Data/ZIP-Codes-and-Postal-Cities/c3xr-3jw2/data . After the location data is pulled the next dataset that i will combine the location with is the Foursquare location data of Los Angeles.
